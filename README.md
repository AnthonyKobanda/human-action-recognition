## **Introduction**

Classifying pedestrians' every-day life actions is a state-of-the art topic in computer vision, including a lot of sub-topics like pedestrian detection, segmentation, video consolidation, classification, etc.

To recognize an action, a human being would localize the person first, analyze the position of its body-parts, see how these are moving and interacting,    and classify accordingly.

We propose here to reproduce this process, using the information of body-parts position (pedestrian keypoints/skeleton) along pedestrian videos.
The data to process is a sequence of labelled 3D coordinates on pedestrians, and the output is the label of an action (walking, running, biking, falling on the ground, fighting, etc.).
